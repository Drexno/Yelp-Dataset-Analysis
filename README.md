Exploratory analysis on yelp dataset

Yelp is a platform for users to rate and review businesses. It was founded in 2005 and has business listing from major cities in over 20 countries.

Businesses across categories can list themselves on Yelp. Users can add other users as friends or follow them as fans. Users who leave thoughtful reviews, upload awesome photos, send compliments and up-vote reviews can apply for elite status for a given year.


The main objective is to explore the data and try and find insights that might be useful for the platform or the businesses using it. The data was visualized using Tableau and SAS.
